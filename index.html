    <h1>Brendan's Film Recommendations</h1>
    <section class="box">
        <h2>Barry Lyndon</h2>
        <h3>Written and Directed by Stanley Kubrick</h3>
        <section class="innerbox">
            <p>Stanley Kubrick is known for many films such as, <i>The Shining</i>, 
               <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>, and <i>Clockwork Orange</i>. However,
               this film is one of his films he wrote and directed himself.
            </p>
            <p>This films an absolute masterpiece in everyway! The story is
               incredibly funny, but also extremely moving and sad. It also features
               arguably some of the best cinematography of all time! Most shots look
               as if they are a painting right out of the 18th century! While it is
               long, there is an intermission in the middle of the film, if you need a
               break or just want to finish it another day.
            </p>
            <p>
                The film is 3 hours and 5 minutes, and is rated PG. While this film is
                rated PG it does contain some vulgar language, partial nudity, and violent
                deaths or acts. If this film were to come out today it would be rated PG-13.

        <h2>Harakiri</h2>
        <h3>Directed by Masaki Kobayashi and Written by Shinobu Hashimoto</h3>
        <section class="innerbox">
            <p>Masaki Kobayashi is one of the greatest and most well Japanese filmmaker
               of his time! He created other classic films such as <i>Kwaidan</i>, 
               <i>Samurai Rebellion</i>, and his most well known work <i>The Human Condition</i>
               series.
            </p>
            <p>This film is incredibly well made and extremely well paced! The dialouge
               is absolutely fascinating, and the shots in this film are absolutely impeccable!
               It features an excellent fight scene with some of the coolest cinematography
               in a samurai film! The story however is what is truly special about this film.
               The intensity and constant twists keep you on your toes, and it truly stays that
               way till the credits roll. I can't recommend this film enough!
            </p>
            <p>This film is 2 hours and 15 minutes, and is not rated. Beware this Film
               go in depth on very serious and heavy issues such as suicide and loss.

        <h2>Watership Down</h2>
        <h3>Directed and Written by Martin Rosen</h3>
        <section class="innerbox">
            <p>Martin Rosen is an extremely underrated and lesser known director, who has not
               done too many films. His most notable film other than this one would be <i>The
               Plague Dogs</i>, which is another animated adaptation of a Richard Adams novel.
            </p>
            <p>This film is one of my absolute favorite adaptations of one of my favorite novels!
               While this film differs strongly from the novel, it still gets most parts across,
               and almost makes it's own message and story in a way. The violence and the story
               is extremely jarring and intense throughout, but I think that's why it is so loved,
               and still looked at to this day. It features some beautifully drawn animation, and
               also features some stellar voice actors! I love this movie to death, and have ever
               since my first viewing.
            </p>
            <p>This film is an hour and 42 minutes, and is PG. While, this film is rated PG,
               it does contain scenes of intense and violent deaths, along with intense and
               frightening scenes that may not be acceptable for children.
